You know, public speaking (or may be speaking in general) was not one of my strongest skills. 
When I go to stage, I get some internal constraint that does not allow me to release my full potencial. 
Sometimes when I pitch I like like cannot fully explain the idea of my project.
Or for example, recently I went to technical interview like like the one they do in google.
I started thinking of speaking being my largest weaknesses.

But let me show something cool, that I belive can help me to overcome stage fear. And what I think is practise. 
But it's not easy to practice in home alone or with friends. You know, there are some challenges. 
Like how to evaluate my performance or like what are common pitfalls I am making. And like doing that with friends makes them bored.
First of all, let me put on these fancy glasses that will plunge me to stage atmosphere. 
// Demo. (explain what is what).
Well, I believe that we can teach ourselves to become masters.
